# Calculate Ebook Prices Project
This application allows users to query the prices of ebooks in Polish z≈Çoty (PLN) based on their release date for a given list of authors and titles. The obtained data is stored in a database, including information about the exchange rate and the table number from which it originates.

## Introduction
The main goal is to determine the ebook price in PLN for a specific date, given a list of authors and titles. The data is fetched by querying the iTunes Search API for ebook details and the NBP API for exchange rates.

## Technologies
- `Python`
- `Flask`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `Docker`
- Other dependencies (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## How It Works
1. The application sends queries to the iTunes Search API to fetch ebook details.
2. Exchange rates are obtained from the NBP API.
3. The obtained data is organized and stored in a PostgreSQL database.
4. The output is structured according to the specified format.

## APIs Used
- iTunes Search API
- NBP API
